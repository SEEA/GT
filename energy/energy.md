## Main findings and discussion

### Flows from the environment to the economy

The Guatemalan economy uses several types of energy resources directly from the environment in order to satisfy both the needs of production and those of final consumption. Water's potential energy and thermal energy from volcanic activity were key resources in the production of electricity. The country also extracted crude oil and natural gas in some regions, which were destined almost exclusively for the export market. Guatemalans also imported coal from other countries. Nevertheless, in Guatemala the biggest source of energy obtained directly from the environment was biomass in the form of fuel wood for domestic use and sugarcane bagasse for industrial use, mainly in the production of electricity.

The table below shows the relative structure of primary energy sources for Guatemala in terajoules (TJ). It is evident that biomass is extremely important for the country with a use share of around 83% of all primary energy sources. And within that category it is evident that fuelwood powers household activities with 224,227.3 TJ or 90% of that biomass. The second most important source of primary energy is coal, which is used mainly for the production of electricity and is mostly imported. Hydro and geoenergy are also important for the country with around 20,534 TJ used in the year 2006. Even if oil production in the country is important as a source of foreign income, its direct use in Guatemala is minimal, with a share of about 1% of primary resources.

### Energy within the economy

A total of 483,947.3 TJ[^8] of energy in all its forms were available to the Guatemalan economy in 2006. That energy was used i) as intermediate consumption by economic sectors in the form of inputs in the production of goods and services, and ii) as final consumption of households, the government, and non-profit institutions in various processes, such as cooking or artificial lighting.

[^8]: Some of this energy was produced locally and a portion was imported.

In the following figure, we coded the different combinations of economic sectors and energy products according to its total use by different tonalities. Darker tones represent higher uses of an energy product relative to the entire's economy use of all energy types in terajoules.
